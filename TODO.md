## Possible Improvements

-   Better responsive/adaptive (MUI, TailwindCSS).
-   Fix Navbar Responsiveness(Add Hamburger or SideNav or BottomNav for mobile).
-   Use Firestore Query while fetching data rather than fetching all data then filtering for better performance and scalability.
-   Use Firebase Auth userdata instead of redux state for better performance.
-   Add playlist feature (using redux).
-   Store currently playing in local storage to persist after refresh.
